  <p class="full-about hide">Ligia Saldaña Martorell – who has more than twenty years of professional experience, has been working as a licensed architect in Ponce for more than fifteen years.  During this time she has been involved in a number of government owned projects such as: the restoration of the century old historic marketplace in the heart of Ponce, the reuse and expansion of the old fire station next to the Teatro La Perla and the remodeling of the Addelina Coppin Alvarado Library for the UPR-Ponce Campus.  In the private sector she currently finished supervising the construction work for the new facilities for the Fundación Biblioteca Rafael Hernandez Colon.  This project includes the adaptive reuse of a century old building originally commissioned as the Spanish Court of Law.
Ms. Saldaña received her Bachelor’s Degree in Architecture from Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) in 1993.  During her formative years she had the opportunity to travel extensively throughout Europe.  She also spent a semester in Rome studying design, photography and architectural history.  In the summer of 1992 she was the recipient of a scholarship to attend the Ford Mellon Minority Research Program in the University of California- Los Angeles (UCLA); during which time she investigated the role of both memory and sensory perception in the personal experience of space.
<br><br>In fall 2010 she was awarded a scholarship to attend a week long continuing education course on the use and application of natural stone.  Sponsored by Marmomacc/Veronafiere it was held in Verona, Italy.  In August 2012 she was selected as a member of the jury panel that evaluated the first edition of the “Concurso de Proyectos de Fin de Carrera” organized by the Puerto Rico College of Architects. Currently serves as a member of the CReSO Commision which seeks to advance the professional interests of all architects in the southern and western part of the island.
<br><br>Ms. Saldaña has been part of the Pontifical Catholic University’s School of Architecture faculty since 2009.  During this time she has taught theory courses in history and preservation as well as several design studio courses. In September 2012 she visited Port au Prince, Haiti as part of a humanitarian effort to aid “Limbs for Haiti” in the design and establishment of an orthopedic/prosthetic clinic in this nation’s capital.  Led by Prof. Saldaña, this collaboration brought together six-(6) professors and close to sixty-(60) second year architecture students; and exposed them to the reality of designing in a devastated landscape while realizing the important role of architecture as a life changing agent. In the summer of 2015 Prof. Saldaña organized and participated in a summer program which took students to visit and learn from places such as: Munich, Salzburg, Vienna, city of Prague, Leipzig, Dresden, Berlin and Madrid.
